    <h2>Guiding Principles and Initial Content Development</h2>

    <h2>Spiritual Progression Portfolio</h2>

    <h3>Guiding Principles</h3>
    <p>
      The following three guiding principles form the foundation of my spiritual and professional portfolios.
      These principles guide my decisions, learning, and behavior as I grow spiritually and prepare for a career in information technology.
    </p>

    <h3>Guiding Principle 1: Faith as an Anchor for Consistent Growth</h3>
    <p>
      Faith provides stability, direction, and hope during periods of effort and uncertainty. Ether 12:4 teaches that faith produces hope that acts as an anchor to the soul,
      allowing individuals to remain “sure and steadfast” while continuing in good works. This principle emphasizes consistency rather than short-term results.
    </p>
    <p>
      This guiding principle applies spiritually by encouraging steady discipleship and trust in the Lord’s timing. Professionally, it supports patience and persistence while developing technical skills.
      Learning IT concepts, troubleshooting systems, and gaining experience often require sustained effort before visible results appear. Faith-centered consistency helps maintain motivation and focus during this process.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Aligned Materials:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ether 12:4</li>
      <li>Russell M. Nelson, <em>Make Time for the Lord</em></li>
      <li>3 Nephi 13:19–22</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Guiding Principle 2: Humility and Accountability Lead to Strength</h3>
    <p>
      Humility allows growth to occur by acknowledging limitations and relying on correct principles. Ether 12:27 teaches that weakness is given so individuals may become humble
      and that weakness can become strength through faith and grace. This principle reframes mistakes and limitations as opportunities for refinement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spiritually, this principle encourages repentance, learning, and reliance on the Savior. Professionally, humility is essential in IT roles where errors can occur and continuous learning is required.
      Accountability, self-review, and willingness to improve support ethical behavior and long-term competence.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Aligned Materials:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ether 12:27</li>
      <li>Mosiah 4:29–30</li>
      <li>Camille N. Johnson, <em>Invite Christ to Author Your Story</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Guiding Principle 3: Agency and Diligent Action Create Meaningful Outcomes</h3>
    <p>
      Agency requires deliberate action aligned with correct values. Doctrine and Covenants 58:27–28 teaches that individuals should be “anxiously engaged in a good cause”
      and act of their own free will. Growth occurs when responsibility is accepted rather than avoided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spiritually, this principle reinforces obedience and intentional discipleship. Professionally, it supports ethical initiative, responsibility, and stewardship.
      In system administration, trusted access and authority require proactive responsibility, disciplined decision-making, and respect for organizational policies.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Aligned Materials:</strong></p>

    <h2>Ethical Dilemma Analysis: Misuse of Administrative Privileges</h2>
    <p>
      A common ethical dilemma in system administration involves the misuse of administrative privileges. In this scenario, a system administrator used elevated access to view confidential user information
      that was unrelated to assigned job responsibilities. Although no data was altered, copied, or shared externally, the access violated organizational policies and breached user trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      The individuals involved included the system administrator and the organization responsible for safeguarding sensitive information. Administrative access exists to maintain systems, resolve issues, and ensure availability,
      not for personal curiosity or convenience. In this case, system logs recorded the unauthorized access, allowing the organization to identify the issue and investigate the activity accurately.
    </p>
    <p>
      The initial response involved reviewing access logs, documenting the incident, and revoking unnecessary privileges. Management also reinforced access control policies and reminded staff of ethical responsibilities tied to administrative authority.
      Additional steps included reviewing internal procedures and emphasizing the principle of least-privilege access to reduce future risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      From an ethical perspective, this dilemma demonstrates that technical capability does not justify unrestricted access. Professional responsibility requires restraint, integrity, and respect for privacy at all times.
      Even when no immediate harm occurs, misuse of access undermines trust and can expose organizations to legal, financial, and reputational consequences.
      Ethical system administration depends on disciplined decision-making, transparency, and alignment with professional standards and organizational values.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Reflective Activity: Temple-Focused Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Taking time for focused spiritual reflection provides clarity, peace, and perspective. In a sacred setting such as the temple, or in a quiet space dedicated to reflection,
      it becomes easier to step away from distractions and evaluate priorities. This type of reflection emphasizes order, purpose, and alignment between beliefs and actions,
      allowing individuals to reset their focus on what matters most.
    </p>
    <p>
      During reflective moments, principles such as accountability, stewardship, and diligence become more apparent. Spiritual clarity supports professional growth by reinforcing the importance of ethical behavior and responsible decision-making.
      When the mind is calm and focused, it becomes easier to recognize how spiritual commitments influence daily work habits, interactions with others, and long-term goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elder Bednar’s analogy of intertwined strands illustrates how spiritual, professional, and personal aspects of life are not separate but deeply connected. Growth in one area strengthens the others.
      Reflection helps identify areas where improvement is needed and encourages consistency between values and actions. It also provides perspective on challenges, helping individuals respond with patience rather than frustration.
    </p>
    <p>
      This reflective practice contributes to professional development by encouraging intentional effort rather than reactive behavior. It supports ethical awareness, humility, and self-discipline,
      qualities essential in IT roles that involve trust, access, and responsibility. By regularly reflecting on spiritual priorities, professional actions become more deliberate, ethical, and aligned with long-term growth and service-oriented goals.
    </p>

  <h2>Week 4 Expansion: Agency, Growth, and Integration</h2>

  <h3>Expanded Spiritual Reflection: Agency and Development</h3>
  <p>
    Agency plays a central role in spiritual and professional development. Doctrine and Covenants 58:26–28 teaches
    that individuals are not commanded in all things but are expected to act with initiative and responsibility.
    Growth occurs when effort is intentional rather than reactive. This principle reinforces the idea that progress
    requires active engagement and personal accountability.
  </p>
  <p>
    Applying agency requires choosing discipline, consistency, and ethical behavior even when outcomes are not
    immediate. In both spiritual growth and professional preparation, meaningful progress results from repeated,
    deliberate decisions aligned with correct principles. Agency strengthens self-reliance while reinforcing
    responsibility for choices and outcomes.
  </p>

  <h3>Professional and Spiritual Alignment</h3>
  <p>
    Professional competencies in information technology closely align with spiritual guiding principles.
    Skills such as system administration, troubleshooting, documentation, and access control require trust,
    accountability, and disciplined decision-making. These professional expectations reflect spiritual principles
    of stewardship, honesty, and responsibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    Faith-based principles guide ethical behavior in technical environments by reinforcing respect for systems,
    data, and users. Applying spiritual values to professional tasks encourages thoughtful action, careful judgment,
    and long-term reliability rather than short-term convenience. This alignment supports consistent growth and
    ethical integrity in IT roles.
  </p>

  <h3>Ethical Dilemma Alternative and Ethical Principles</h3>
  <p>
    The ethical dilemma involving misuse of administrative privileges highlights the importance of responsibility,
    restraint, and accountability. Essential ethical principles in this scenario include honesty, least-privilege
    access, transparency, and respect for privacy.
  </p>
  <p>
    A stronger ethical alternative would involve strict role-based access controls, documented justification for
    elevated permissions, and regular auditing of administrative activity. Access should be granted only when
    required for assigned tasks and removed immediately when no longer necessary.
  </p>
  <p>
    This alternative approach better protects users, administrators, and organizations by reducing risk,
    preserving trust, and reinforcing professional standards. Proactive safeguards prevent misuse before it
    occurs and promote ethical consistency across technical operations.
  </p>

  <h3>Project Refinement and Ethical Integration</h3>
  <p>
    The selected project for refinement is this IT497 GitHub portfolio. The refinement focused on improving
    structure, clarity, and ethical integration while presenting both spiritual and professional development
    in a unified format.
  </p>
  <p>
    Key improvements included clearer organization of content, expanded ethical analysis, and stronger alignment
    between guiding principles and technical competencies. Ethical considerations such as accountability,
    stewardship, and appropriate access were intentionally emphasized throughout the portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
    This refinement demonstrates how thoughtful documentation and ethical reflection enhance the value of
    technical work. By integrating ethical reasoning into project presentation, the portfolio reflects disciplined
    decision-making, professional responsibility, and long-term growth in information technology.
